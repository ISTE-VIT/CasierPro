This smart lock based IoT system will give you a two step authentication process. First thing here is instead keys we will have RFID tags and the second thing is you need to have a mobile app which is designed by us. You should successfully authenticate the app using your fingerprint then if you place the respective RFID tag, the door will be unlocked. These two things will be in series so, you should successfully authenticate both to unlock the door.

The connections should be made as in the circuit diagram.
